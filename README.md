# Correlated MIS for bidirectional rendering algorithms

![](Teaser.png)

Implementation of the Eurographics 2021 Paper "Correlated Multiple Importance Sampling for Bidirectional Algorithms" by Pascal Grittmann, Iliyan Georgiev, and Philipp Slusallek.

This is the original codebase used to generate all results and figures in the paper and its supplemental.

## Dependencies

### SeeSharp ([version 0.1.0](https://github.com/pgrit/SeeSharp/releases/tag/v0.1.0))

The rendering experiments are based on the SeeSharp rendering framework. Which, in turn, requires:

- A C++14 compiler
- [.NET 5.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Embree and TBB

The C++ dependency wrapper of SeeSharp (called SeeCore) needs to be compiled and in the PATH. Detailed instructions can be found in the [README.md](https://github.com/pgrit/SeeSharp/) of the SeeSharp framework.

Clone the SeeSharp repository next to this one. The project files assume that running ``cd ../SeeSharp/`` from within this folder leads to the root directory of the SeeSharp framework.

### Figuregen (optional)

The figures where generated with figuregen version 0.6.1. You can install that exact version via pip:

```
python -m pip install figuregen==0.6.1
```

## Building and running

To compile and run the VCM experiment in Release mode:

```
cd VcmExperiment
dotnet run -c Release
```

To compile and run the BDPT experiment in Release mode:

```
cd BidirExperiment
dotnet run -c Release
```

## Creating figures

The comparison figures can be generated by running, for example:

```
cd VcmExperiment
python ./makefigures.py
```

## Test scenes and licensing

The source code, but NOT the figures and test scenes, is released under the same MIT License as the original SeeSharp framework.

Copyright of the test scenes:

- The ContemporaryBathroom, ModernHall, and MinimalistWhiteRoom scenes were shared by [Wig42 on Blend Swap](https://www.blendswap.com/profile/130393) (CC-BY)
- The TargetPractice scene was modelled by Vladislav Hnatovskiy and Mira Niemann (CC-BY). License info on the textures and meshes of that scene can be found in the [Scenes/TargetPractice/License.md](Scenes/TargetPractice/License.md) file.
- The Box, HomeOffice, IndirectRoom, LampCaustic, and RoughGlasses scenes were modelled by Pascal Grittmann (CC-0)

The figures, which are generated by the Python scripts, are part of the published paper and follow the same licensing as the entire paper (i.e., using requires explicit permission etc.).
